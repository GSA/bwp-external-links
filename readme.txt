== Description ==

This plugin gives you total control over external links on your website. This plugin also comes with a comprehensive domain filtering feature. BWP External Links is based on the popular Prime Links phpBB mod by Ken F. Innes IV (Prime Halo).

**Demo**

If you want to see this plugin in action, you can either visit [my website](http://betterwp.net) or [a user's website](http://wordpress.grc.nasa.gov) (NASA Glenn Research Center's Website).

**Some Features**

* Allows you to process links for post contents, comment text, text widgets, or the whole page (**new in 1.1.0**)
* Allows you to add `rel="external"`, `rel="nofollow"` or any custom relation tag you could think of to external links
* Allows you to specify CSS classes for both local and external links
* Allows you to choose whether or not to open a completely new window for each external link
* Allows you to choose between three 'new window' modes: onclick, target or jQuery
* Allows you to prefix external links with anything (typical use could be a redirection page that warns your visitors about the danger of visiting external sites)
* Allows you to specify which sub-domain of your website/blog to be considered local
* WordPress Multi-site compatible (not tested with WPMU)
* And more...
